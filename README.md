## **🏗️ Project Overview**

We now live in a world where AI governs access to information, opportunity and freedom. However, AI systems can perpetuate racism, sexism, ableism, and other harmful forms of discrimination, therefore, presenting significant threats to our society - from healthcare, to economic opportunity, to our criminal justice system.

The Algorithmic Justice League is an organization that combines art and research to illuminate the social implications and harms of artificial intelligence.

AJL’s mission is to raise public awareness about the impacts of AI, equip advocates with resources to bolster campaigns, build the voice and choice of the most impacted communities, and galvanize researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to prevent AI harms.

AI is transforming healthcare, yet dermatology AI tools often underperform for people with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. This can lead to diagnostic errors, delayed treatments, and health disparities for underserved communities. This challenge from Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League invited us to help address this issue by building an inclusive machine learning model for dermatology. 

We aimed to train a model that can classify 21 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones, using the datasets provided by the competition as our starting point.

---

## **🧠 Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)

---

## **📈 Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

---

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

To address model fairness, we leveraged data augmentation techniques to balance the number of entries of skin conditions affecting various skin tones. Then, we validated the model performance on a validation data set to assess the impact on classification accuracy across different skin tones.

We want AI to serve everyone equally, whether they have different skin colors, gender identities, sexual orientations, physical abilities, or anything else that makes each person unique. Our work will aid the pursuit of this goal.
